Recent advancements in the joint extraction of entities and relations have led to the development of innovative approaches aimed at enhancing the performance of this task, with a notable emphasis on multitask learning frameworks. One such approach introduces a unified multi-task learning framework that divides the task into three sub-tasks: subject extraction using a type-attentional method, subject-aware relation prediction, and object extraction through a question generation based QA method. This framework is designed to overcome challenges such as template-dependency, non-entity detection, and non-predefined relation prediction by integrating the sub-tasks through parameter sharing, demonstrating superior performance on benchmark datasets. Another study addresses the limitations of the CopyRE model, particularly its difficulty in distinguishing between head and tail entities and its inability to predict multi-token entities. By analyzing these issues, the study proposes a novel model structure, CopyMTL, which incorporates a multi-task learning framework with a copy mechanism to significantly improve entity extraction accuracy and the prediction of multi-token entities. Adding to these advancements, a paper introduces the Progressive Multitask learning model with Explicit Interactions (PMEI), based on the observation that correlations exist between outputs of some related tasks (e.g., entity recognition and relation extraction tasks), which reflect the relevant features that need to be extracted from the input. The PMEI model exploits task predictions in lower layers of the neural model, referred to as early predictions, and controls the injection of these predictions to ensure that good task-specific representations can be extracted for classification. This approach has produced state-of-the-art results on the joint entity and relation extraction task across multiple benchmark datasets. Collectively, these studies highlight the ongoing efforts to refine joint extraction techniques, showcasing the potential of multi-task learning and innovative model structures in addressing the inherent challenges of this research area. The integration of early predictions in the PMEI model represents a novel strategy that complements the other approaches by focusing on the exploitation of task correlations to enhance performance, thereby contributing to the broader move towards more sophisticated models capable of handling the complexities of entity and relation extraction more effectively.
