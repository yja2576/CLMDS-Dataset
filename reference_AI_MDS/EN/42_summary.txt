The field of Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) has seen innovative approaches aimed at improving the accuracy of sense identification amidst inherent challenges. One study introduces a Coarse Sense Inventory (CSI) that simplifies WordNet's complex structure into broader categories, significantly enhancing model performance with an 85.9% F1 score by addressing the fine granularity of sense inventories. This method not only streamlines the annotation process but also showcases the model's ability to generalize across less common or unseen words through a few-shot evaluation. Another study draws inspiration from quantum mechanics to tackle the issue of data imbalance and the long-tail distribution of word senses, proposing a novel representation method in Hilbert space that leverages the concept of superposition states for more accurate sense representations from limited data, showing promising results in addressing Long-Tail Senses (LTSs) and cross-lingual datasets. Adding to these methodologies, the paper on SensEmBERT proposes a knowledge-based approach that combines the expressive power of language modeling with the vast knowledge contained in a semantic network to produce high-quality latent semantic representations of word meanings in multiple languages. SensEmBERT, without relying on manual semantic annotations, achieves or surpasses state-of-the-art results on the English Word Sense Disambiguation task and demonstrates effectiveness in other languages, outperforming existing state-of-the-art on all multilingual WSD datasets. Together, these studies, despite their varied approaches—from simplifying sense inventories and leveraging quantum-inspired representation techniques to integrating semantic networks with language modeling—contribute significantly to the field by offering solutions that improve sense disambiguation accuracy, model generalizability, and the ability to handle multilingual datasets effectively.
