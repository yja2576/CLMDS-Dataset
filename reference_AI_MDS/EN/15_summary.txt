In the quest to enhance the accuracy and reliability of treatment effect estimation from complex datasets, recent advancements have introduced innovative methodologies that address the challenges posed by incomplete compliance, unmeasured confounders, and the integration of data from multiple sources. One such breakthrough is the Data-Driven Variable Decomposition (D$^2$VD) algorithm, which offers a novel solution to the problem of confounding in observational studies by automatically distinguishing between confounders and adjustment variables in high-dimensional datasets. This approach not only facilitates more precise variable separation but also enables tighter confidence intervals in treatment effect estimation, showcasing superior performance over traditional methods in both synthetic and real-world datasets, such as online advertising. Complementing this, another approach focuses on the estimation of the local average treatment effect (LATE) through a novel nonparametric identification from separately observed datasets, employing a weighted least squares estimator that circumvents the limitations of inverse probability weighted (IPW) estimators and direct least squares methods. Additionally, the challenge of data fusion is addressed through the innovative use of Group Instrumental Variables (GIV), which, within a Meta-EM framework, allows for the reconstruction of source labels and facilitates IV-based regression through a unified, iterative optimization strategy. These methodologies collectively represent a significant leap forward in the field of treatment effect estimation, offering robust solutions that not only overcome the limitations of existing approaches but also leverage the potential of mixed datasets for real-world applications. The integration of the D$^2$VD algorithm into this landscape highlights the importance of precise variable identification and adjustment in achieving accurate treatment effect estimates, thereby complementing and enhancing the contributions of the other approaches in addressing the multifaceted challenges of causal inference in observational studies and data fusion scenarios.
