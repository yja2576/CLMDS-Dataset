Recent advancements in visual recognition have explored the challenges of long-tailed distributions and the robustness of deep networks to rare events, highlighting the complexity and nuances of deploying these technologies in real-world applications. On one hand, progress in long-tailed visual recognition has been achieved through both complex paradigms, such as meta-learning, and simpler training refinements, including adjustments in data distribution and loss functions. This approach has led to the development of a novel data augmentation technique based on class activation maps, significantly improving recognition accuracy on benchmark datasets. On the other hand, the robustness of deep networks to objects in unusual poses has been scrutinized, revealing that even state-of-the-art networks struggle with this task, experiencing a notable drop in accuracy. This challenge persists across various network designs and training strategies, although networks trained on larger datasets show some improvement. Both studies underscore the importance of dataset composition and training strategies in enhancing the performance and applicability of deep learning models, while also pointing to inherent limitations in current methodologies. Together, these insights contribute to a broader understanding of the challenges facing visual recognition technologies and underscore the need for continued innovation in training and data augmentation techniques to achieve robust, real-world applicability.
