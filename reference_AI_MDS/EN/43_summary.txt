Recent advancements in Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) have been marked by significant contributions from two distinct approaches. On one hand, the introduction of a Coarse Sense Inventory (CSI), which simplifies WordNet's fine granularity by mapping concepts to 45 broader labels, has demonstrated a notable improvement in WSD performance, achieving an F1 score of 85.9%. This approach not only enhances model accuracy but also facilitates ease of use and descriptiveness in annotation tasks, proving its effectiveness in handling the long-standing issue of sense differentiation. On the other hand, the development of transformer-based architectures has revolutionized WSD by significantly boosting model performances, particularly in English. However, the exploration of WSD in languages other than English has been limited due to the scarcity of testing data and complex evaluation settings. Addressing this gap, a cross-lingual evaluation benchmark named XL-WSD has been proposed, featuring sense-annotated datasets in 18 languages across six linguistic families and encouraging the evaluation of both neural and knowledge-based approaches in a multilingual context. This benchmark highlights the potential of zero-shot knowledge transfer across languages, especially for low-resourced languages where large pre-trained multilingual models have shown limitations. Together, these studies underscore the importance of both methodological innovation in sense inventory management and the expansion of WSD research to a multilingual framework, paving the way for more generalized and accessible WSD solutions.
