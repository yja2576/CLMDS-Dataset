In the realm of estimating treatment effects from observational data, recent advancements have introduced a variety of innovative methodologies to tackle the inherent challenges associated with data fusion, practical limitations of data acquisition, and the complexity of high-dimensional variables. Among these, the Data-Driven Variable Decomposition (D$^2$VD) algorithm stands out by offering a solution to automatically separate confounders and adjustment variables in observational studies, thereby enabling more accurate treatment effect estimation with tighter confidence intervals, especially in scenarios characterized by high-dimensional data. This approach complements the Data Efficient Individual Treatment Effect Estimation (DEITEE) method, which reduces data requirements by identifying a minimal set of variables for accurate estimation, and a novel strategy that addresses the estimation of the local average treatment effect (LATE) in the presence of incomplete compliance and disjointed datasets through a weighted least squares estimator. Furthermore, the introduction of a method to overcome challenges posed by omitted source labels and unmeasured confounders in mixed datasets, through reconstructing the source label and modeling it as a Group Instrumental Variable (GIV) within a Meta-EM framework, signifies a significant leap forward. This framework estimates individual treatment assignment probability and infers treatment effect by mapping raw data into a representation space, estimating distribution differences, and modeling the GIV for different treatment assignment mechanisms through an alternating training strategy. Collectively, these studies not only expand the toolkit available for researchers and practitioners aiming to derive meaningful insights from observational data to inform treatment decisions and policy-making but also showcase the diversity of approaches to overcoming the practical challenges of data-related limitations and complex data structures in the estimation of treatment effects. The integration of the D$^2$VD algorithm into this body of work highlights the importance of distinguishing between confounders and adjustment variables in enhancing the precision of treatment effect estimates, thereby contributing to the broader field of causal inference with a nuanced understanding of variable impacts in observational studies.
