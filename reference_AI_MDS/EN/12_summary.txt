In the realm of deep learning, two recent studies have addressed the critical challenges of training models in the presence of noisy labels and dataset biases, which can significantly impair model generalization and accuracy. The first study introduces ALASCA, a novel method that enhances the robustness of feature extractors against label noise through adaptive label smoothing and auxiliary classifiers, leveraging the concept that label smoothing can implicitly induce Lipschitz regularization. This approach not only improves the performance of existing noise-robust methods but does so with remarkable efficiency. On the other hand, the second study tackles the issue of dataset bias and the inadvertent highlighting of noisy labels by traditional debiasing techniques. It proposes a novel strategy, DENEB, which employs an entropy-based debiasing followed by denoising, effectively distinguishing between bias-aligned and bias-conflicting samples without diminishing the importance of the latter. Both studies underscore the importance of addressing label noise and dataset bias in improving the reliability and generalization of deep learning models. They contribute innovative solutions that, while distinct in their methodologies—focusing on adaptive regularization and entropy-based sample selection—share the common goal of enhancing model performance in less-than-ideal data conditions.
