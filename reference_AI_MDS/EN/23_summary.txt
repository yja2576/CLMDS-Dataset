Both studies address the challenge of analyzing medical data—specifically, COVID-19 imaging and EEG signals for seizure analysis—through innovative self-supervised learning methods, circumventing the need for large volumes of annotated datasets, which are expensive, time-consuming, and often reliant on subjective clinician interpretation. The first research introduces a novel approach utilizing graph neural networks to analyze CT lung images by incorporating anatomical context at both regional and patient levels, demonstrating superior performance in identifying clinically relevant features and quantifying COVID-19 progression across different hospitals. The second study proposes a self-supervised framework for detecting seizure events and affected brain regions in EEG signals, leveraging local structural and contextual information without requiring labeled seizure data. This method, which employs positive and negative sub-graphs and minimizes contrastive and generative losses, outperforms existing machine learning-based algorithms in seizure analysis, even those requiring labeled data. Both approaches highlight the potential of self-supervised learning in medical imaging and signal analysis, offering scalable, cost-effective solutions that can adapt to various contexts and improve diagnostic accuracy without extensive labeled datasets.
