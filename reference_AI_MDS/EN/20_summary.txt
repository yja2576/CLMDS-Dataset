Both research studies delve into the optimization of multi-agent systems for transportation and delivery problems, albeit with distinct focuses and methodologies. The first study explores the Cooperative Pickup and Delivery Problem (PDP) through a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning framework, addressing the challenges of modeling the structural dependency between pickup and delivery pairs and the cooperation among vehicles. It introduces a paired context embedding, cooperative multi-agent decoders, and a cooperative A2C algorithm, demonstrating superior performance over baselines in both synthetic and real-world datasets. The second study investigates the multi-agent transportation (MAT) problem, emphasizing the flexibility of agents to separate from containers to reduce makespan and solve otherwise unsolvable scenarios. It establishes the NP-completeness of the MAT problem, proposes a reduction to a sequence of SAT problems for optimization, and compares its MAT solver against a MAPD solver using conflict-based search, highlighting differences in efficiency and applicability based on input characteristics and movement constraints. Both studies contribute to the field by offering innovative solutions to complex logistics and transportation problems, showcasing the potential of multi-agent systems in enhancing operational efficiency and adaptability in dynamic environments.
