Both research studies delve into the optimization of multi-agent systems for transportation and delivery tasks, albeit with distinct approaches and problem frameworks. The first study enhances the efficiency and effectiveness of the Multi-Agent Pickup and Delivery (MAPD) problem through the integration of a novel path planning algorithm, Safe Interval Path Planning with Reservation Table (SIPPwRT), which accommodates the kinematic constraints of real robots, enabling continuous movement and direct consideration of non-holonomic robots. This approach is demonstrated to significantly improve the computation of paths for a large number of agents and tasks, outperforming existing algorithms in automated warehouse scenarios. The second study introduces the multi-agent transportation (MAT) problem, emphasizing the flexibility of agents to detach from containers, thereby reducing makespan and enabling solutions in otherwise unsolvable scenarios. It establishes the NP-completeness of the MAT problem and proposes a solution method that reduces it to a sequence of SAT problems, optimized for makespan. This study also includes an empirical evaluation of the MAT solver against a MAPD solver using conflict-based search, highlighting differences in performance based on input characteristics and movement constraints. Together, these studies contribute to the broader understanding of multi-agent systems in logistics and transportation, showcasing innovative solutions to enhance efficiency, flexibility, and applicability in complex, dynamic environments.
