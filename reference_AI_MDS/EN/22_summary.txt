In the realm of medical and educational diagnostics, two pioneering studies have introduced self-supervised frameworks to tackle the challenges of sparse data and the lack of labeled datasets, respectively, in cognitive diagnosis and seizure detection through EEG signals. The first study introduces a Self-supervised Cognitive Diagnosis (SCD) framework that enhances graph-based cognitive diagnosis by generating sparse views of the graph to focus on students with limited interaction records, thereby addressing the Long Tail Effect prevalent in educational data analysis. This approach is validated through extensive experiments, showing significant improvement in diagnosing students with sparse data. On the other hand, the second study proposes a novel method for seizure detection that does not require access to labeled seizure data, leveraging local structural and contextual information within EEG graphs. By employing positive and negative sub-graphs and minimizing contrastive and generative losses, this method outperforms existing machine learning algorithms in seizure analysis, even in cases where access to all EEG channels is restricted. Both studies underscore the potential of self-supervised learning in enhancing the accuracy of diagnostic tools in fields where data scarcity and the absence of labeled datasets pose significant challenges, marking a significant step forward in the application of artificial intelligence in healthcare and education.
