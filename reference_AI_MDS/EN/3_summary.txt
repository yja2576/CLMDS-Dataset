Both studies delve into enhancing the understanding and simulation of human reasoning capabilities through advanced computational models, albeit with distinct approaches and applications. The first research introduces a Hierarchical ConViT with Attention-based Relational Reasoner (HCV-ARR) aimed at solving Ravenâ€™s Progressive Matrices (RPMs) by combining convolutional and transformer blocks to perceive and reason about visual patterns and their relations. This method emphasizes the importance of capturing both low-level details and high-level semantics of images to better model the complex reasoning required in RPMs. On the other hand, the second study proposes a novel approach to learning the dynamics of visual relational reasoning by treating it as a path routing task within a structured visual graph, utilizing reinforcement learning to navigate reasoning states and transitions based on visual and textual inputs. This approach seeks to explicitly model the cognitive dynamics of reasoning, offering a clear representation of reasoning states and their evolution over time. Despite their differences in focus and methodology, both studies contribute significantly to the field of artificial intelligence by advancing the understanding of visual reasoning and the simulation of human cognitive processes, showcasing the potential of combining multiple computational techniques to achieve more nuanced and accurate reasoning models.
