Recent advancements in heuristic search have significantly broadened its application in solving complex planning problems, notably in the realms of multi-objective and probabilistic planning. One study introduces innovative heuristic search algorithms, MOLAO* and MOLRTDP, tailored for multi-objective stochastic shortest paths (MOSSPs), aiming to compute a comprehensive set of non-dominated policies. These algorithms are an extension of established stochastic shortest path (SSP) problem-solving methods, enhanced by a variety of domain-independent heuristic functions designed to effectively navigate the stochastic and multi-objective aspects of MOSSPs. Another research effort focuses on probabilistic planning with multi-objective probabilistic temporal logic (PLTL) constraints, proposing novel admissible heuristics that leverage linear programming to estimate the likelihood of partial policies meeting specified constraints. This approach, integrated with the PLTL-dual heuristic search algorithm, facilitates more efficient pruning of infeasible regions, thereby improving the search for cost-optimal policies in stochastic environments. Both studies underscore the utility of heuristic search in addressing the complexity of planning problems by developing algorithms and heuristics that enhance search efficiency and policy optimization in stochastic and multi-objective settings.
