In the realm of estimating treatment effects from complex datasets, two innovative approaches emerge to tackle the challenges posed by incomplete compliance, omitted source labels, and unmeasured confounders. The first approach addresses the estimation of the local average treatment effect (LATE) through a novel problem setting where LATE is nonparametrically identified from separately observed datasets. This method introduces a weighted least squares estimator that simplifies model selection by circumventing the minimax objective formulation, thereby offering a more stable alternative to the direct least squares method and avoiding the pitfalls associated with inverse probability weighted (IPW) estimators. On the other hand, the second approach navigates the intricacies of data fusion from multiple sources with independent treatment assignment mechanisms. It proposes a unified framework that reconstructs source labels as Group Instrumental Variables (GIV), employing IV-based Regression for treatment effect estimation. This framework leverages a Meta-EM algorithm to map raw data into a representation space, estimate distribution differences, and model GIV for different treatment assignment mechanisms through an alternating training strategy. Both studies contribute significantly to the field by providing robust methodologies for treatment effect estimation in scenarios plagued by data fragmentation and confounding variables, demonstrating their effectiveness through both synthetic and real-world datasets. These advancements underscore the importance of innovative statistical techniques in overcoming the limitations of traditional methods, paving the way for more accurate and reliable analyses in the era of big data.
