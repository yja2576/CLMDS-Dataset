Both studies address the challenge of estimating treatment effects from observational data, a task complicated by the presence of confounders—variables that influence both the treatment and the outcome. The first study introduces a Data-Driven Variable Decomposition (D$^2$VD) algorithm that distinguishes between confounders and adjustment variables, which do not affect treatment but predict the outcome, to improve the accuracy and precision of treatment effect estimates in high-dimensional settings. This approach is validated through experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating its superiority over existing methods by providing more accurate estimates with tighter confidence intervals. The second study, meanwhile, emphasizes the necessity of differentiating not only confounders but also instrumental and risk factors—variables that respectively only affect treatment or outcome. It proposes a variational inference method to infer latent factors from observed variables, categorize them into instrumental, confounding, and risk factors, and utilize these disentangled factors for more effective treatment effect estimation. This method's efficacy is showcased across synthetic, benchmark, and real-world datasets. Both pieces of research contribute to the broader understanding of causal inference in observational studies by offering novel methodologies for the identification and utilization of various types of variables, thereby enhancing the precision of treatment effect estimation.
