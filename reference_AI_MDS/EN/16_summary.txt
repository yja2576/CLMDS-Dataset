The field of estimating treatment effects from observational data is advancing through innovative methodologies that address the challenges of data fusion, efficient data use, and the integration of separately observed datasets. The first study introduces the Data Efficient Individual Treatment Effect Estimation (DEITEE) method, which minimizes the need for data at deployment by identifying a crucial subset of variables for accurate treatment effect estimation, demonstrating effectiveness with semi-synthetic and real-world datasets. Similarly, another study proposes a novel approach to overcome the limitations of traditional methods in data fusion scenarios—where datasets from multiple sources with independent treatment assignment mechanisms are merged. This paper suggests reconstructing source labels and modeling them as a Group Instrumental Variable (GIV) within a unified framework (Meta-EM), which facilitates IV-based Regression for more precise treatment effect estimation. This method stands out by mapping raw data into a representation space and iteratively optimizing representations and joint distributions to model GIV effectively, showcasing superiority over state-of-the-art methods in empirical results. On a different note, a second study addresses the estimation of the local average treatment effect (LATE) in situations of incomplete compliance and observed variables in separate datasets, proposing a weighted least squares estimator that simplifies model selection and circumvents the drawbacks of inverse probability weighting (IPW) methods, validated through synthetic and real-world experiments. Collectively, these studies contribute significantly to the broader field by offering novel solutions for the efficient use of available data and the integration of data from multiple sources, thereby enhancing the practical applicability of treatment effect estimation methods in real-world settings. The integration of these approaches—ranging from the efficient identification of minimal variable sets for ITE estimation to the innovative use of GIV for data fusion and the simplification of model selection for LATE estimation—highlights the diverse strategies researchers are employing to navigate the complexities of observational data and improve the accuracy and applicability of treatment effect estimations.
