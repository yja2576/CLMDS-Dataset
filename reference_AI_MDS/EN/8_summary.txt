Recent advancements in self-supervised learning for graph structured data have led to innovative approaches aimed at enhancing graph learning tasks, particularly in scenarios with limited labeled data. One study introduces AFGRL, an augmentation-free self-supervised learning framework for graphs that generates alternative views of a graph by identifying nodes with similar local structural information and global semantics, demonstrating its effectiveness across various node-level tasks such as classification, clustering, and similarity search. Another research effort proposes the Multi-Stage Self-Supervised (M3S) Training Algorithm for Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), which employs a multi-stage training framework alongside the DeepCluster technique to improve GCNs' generalization performance on graphs with few labeled nodes. Both studies highlight the critical role of self-supervised learning in overcoming the challenges of sparse supervision in graph learning tasks, yet they adopt distinct methodologies: one focusing on an augmentation-free approach to preserve the intrinsic properties of graphs, and the other leveraging a structured multi-stage training process to enhance GCN performance. These contributions underscore the diversity and potential of self-supervised learning strategies in advancing graph analysis and understanding.
