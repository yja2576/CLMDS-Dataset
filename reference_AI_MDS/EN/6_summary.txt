Recent advancements in graph learning have underscored the pivotal role of self-supervised learning (SSL) methods, particularly in handling graph-structured data. One innovative approach introduced is the Wiener Graph Deconvolutional Network (WGDN), which challenges the prevailing focus on contrastive models in graph SSL. WGDN employs an augmentation-adaptive decoder, leveraging the graph Wiener filter for superior information reconstruction, thereby suggesting that predictive models with potent decoders can match or surpass the representation capabilities of contrastive models. This notion aligns with the development of AFGRL, an augmentation-free self-supervised learning framework that generates alternative graph views by identifying nodes with similar structural and semantic characteristics, circumventing the need for potentially semantics-altering augmentations. Additionally, the Multi-Stage Self-Supervised (M3S) Training Algorithm enhances the generalization of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) in low-label scenarios by refining the embedding space using the DeepCluster technique. Both AFGRL and M3S, alongside WGDN, highlight the diverse methodologies within SSL for graphsâ€”ranging from eliminating augmentation needs, optimizing training processes, to innovating on predictive models with advanced decoders. Collectively, these studies contribute to a broader understanding of applying SSL in graph analysis, offering insights into overcoming challenges like data augmentation, label scarcity, and the quest for more effective representation learning models. This integrated perspective showcases the dynamic and evolving landscape of graph SSL, where the exploration of different models and techniques continues to enrich the field's understanding and application capabilities.
