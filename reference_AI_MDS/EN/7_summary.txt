In the realm of machine learning, two innovative approaches have been introduced to enhance the learning capabilities from unlabeled data, addressing the challenges in different domains: medical imaging and graph data analysis. The first study presents a novel self-supervised learning framework tailored for medical imaging, particularly focusing on COVID-19 lung images. This method employs a dual-level representation learning objective that leverages the anatomical context by utilizing graph neural networks to map the relationships between different anatomical regions, informed by an anatomical atlas. This approach not only facilitates the detection of deviations in tissue appearance but also enables the handling of images of any size in full resolution, showing promising results in quantifying clinical progression of COVID-19 across patients from various hospitals. On the other hand, the second study delves into graph self-supervised learning, proposing the Wiener Graph Deconvolutional Network (WGDN) as a powerful predictive model. This model stands out by incorporating an augmentation-adaptive decoder powered by a graph Wiener filter, which theoretically and empirically demonstrates superior reconstruction capabilities over traditional contrastive models. Both studies underscore the potential of self-supervised learning in extracting meaningful representations from unlabeled data, whether it be in discerning intricate patterns in medical images or in reconstructing information from graph data, thereby pushing the boundaries of what is achievable in the absence of large annotated datasets.
