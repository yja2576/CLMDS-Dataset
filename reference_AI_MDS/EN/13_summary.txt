In the evolving landscape of estimating treatment effects from observational data, a series of innovative methodologies have emerged, addressing unique challenges associated with data availability, compliance, and the integration of information from multiple sources. Among these, the introduction of the Data-Driven Variable Decomposition (D$^2$VD) algorithm marks a significant advancement, offering a solution to the problem of automatically distinguishing between confounders and adjustment variables in observational studies with high-dimensional variables. This algorithm enhances the accuracy and confidence of treatment effect estimations, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on both synthetic and real-world datasets, including online advertising. Similarly, the Data Efficient Individual Treatment Effect Estimation (DEITEE) method streamlines the estimation process by identifying a crucial subset of variables, minimizing the need for extensive datasets while ensuring precision. Another study introduces a novel approach for estimating the local average treatment effect (LATE) in scenarios of incomplete compliance, employing a weighted least squares estimator that simplifies model selection and overcomes the limitations of traditional inverse probability weighting (IPW) methods. Furthermore, the exploration of data fusion in treatment effect estimation through a framework that leverages Group Instrumental Variables (GIV) for IV-based Regression addresses challenges of omitted source labels and unmeasured confounders, showcasing the Meta-EM framework's ability to iteratively optimize representations and joint distributions for effective treatment effect estimation across mixed datasets. Adding to this body of work, a recent paper emphasizes the importance of differentiating confounding factors from instrumental and risk factors for both average and conditional average treatment effect estimation. It proposes a variational inference approach to infer latent factors from observed variables, disentangle these factors into instrumental, confounding, and risk factors, and use the disentangled factors for treatment effect estimation, demonstrating effectiveness on a wide range of synthetic, benchmark, and real-world datasets. Collectively, these studies underscore the potential of machine learning algorithms in refining decision-making processes by improving the estimation of treatment effects under various constraints, such as data scarcity, compliance issues, and the integration of multi-source data. The concerted effort towards developing more accurate and efficient methodologies in observational studies is evident, with each approach contributing to the broader goal of enhancing the reliability and precision of treatment effect estimations in the face of complex data challenges.
