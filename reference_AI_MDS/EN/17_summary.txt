Recent advancements in machine learning have spotlighted the potential of algorithms to suggest optimal interventions by estimating individual treatment effects (ITEs) from observational data. One study introduces the Data Efficient Individual Treatment Effect Estimation (DEITEE) method, which challenges the conventional assumption of unrestricted data availability at deployment. DEITEE innovatively minimizes the necessity to adjust for confounders at test time, thereby reducing the number of variables needed without sacrificing accuracy. This approach is particularly beneficial in scenarios where data acquisition is a critical part of the analysis, such as in healthcare decision-making for expectant mothers. Another research effort addresses the common oversight in treatment effect estimation methods that assume all observed variables are confounders. It highlights the importance of distinguishing between confounders, instrumental, and risk factors, proposing a variational inference technique to infer latent factors from observed variables. This method effectively disentangles these factors, improving the accuracy of both average and conditional average treatment effect estimations across various datasets. Together, these studies underscore the importance of efficient data use and the nuanced understanding of variable roles in the robust estimation of treatment effects, marking significant progress in the field of observational study analysis.
