Recent studies have illuminated the pressing health challenges in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), focusing on the burden of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) among people living with HIV (PLHIV) and the escalating public health challenge posed by Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). A comprehensive meta-analysis revealed that 6.92% of global new non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) cases in 2019 were attributable to HIV, with significant prevalence in Eastern and Southern Africa, and Eastern Europe and Central Asia, highlighting the increased risk of NHL among PLHIV. Additionally, a systematic review and meta-analysis found notable rates of hypertension, depression, diabetes, and other NCDs among PLHIV in SSA, underscoring the necessity for health system strengthening and integrated healthcare services. Parallelly, a study analyzing data from the Global Burden of Disease Study from 1990 to 2019 identified a dramatic increase in COPD prevalence in SSA, with prevalent cases reaching 10.3 million in 2019, a 117% increase since 1990. This study pinpointed household air pollution from solid fuel as the primary risk factor for COPD, particularly in Central SSA, contributing significantly to the disease's burden through disability and premature mortality. Both sets of findings emphasize the urgent need for comprehensive health strategies that address the dual challenge of infectious diseases like HIV and the growing impact of NCDs, including COPD, to improve overall health outcomes in SSA. This integrated approach aligns with the UNAIDS's '90-90-90' Fast-Track targets and offers critical insights for targeted public health interventions and policy formulation in the region, highlighting the interconnectedness of infectious diseases and NCDs in shaping public health priorities.
