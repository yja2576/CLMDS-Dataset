Recent studies in Korea and the Netherlands have explored the intricate relationship between various subtypes of steatotic liver disease (SLD) and metabolic-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) with the risk of developing cardiovascular disease (CVD) and cardio-metabolic outcomes, respectively. The Korean nationwide cohort study, involving 351,068 individuals aged 47-86 years, highlighted that metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), MASLD with increased alcohol intake (MetALD), and alcohol-related liver disease (ALD) significantly elevate the risk of CVD, with hazard ratios indicating a notable increase in risk compared to individuals without SLD. Conversely, the Dutch study focused on a younger cohort of 1910 children aged 10, revealing a high prevalence of MAFLD—defined by ≥2% liver fat in conjunction with excess adiposity or metabolic risk factors—particularly among children of non-European descent, and associated with a higher risk of cardio-metabolic risk factor clustering. Both studies underscore the importance of recognizing and differentiating between subtypes of liver diseases for better clinical assessments and public health strategies, while also pointing towards the additive impact of alcohol consumption and the significance of socio-economic and ethnic factors in the development of these conditions and their associated risks.
