Recent multicentre cohort and randomized trials have shed light on the treatment strategies for two distinct pediatric conditions, revealing nuanced outcomes that underscore the importance of tailored approaches. A study from the Chinese Neonatal Network, focusing on extremely preterm infants diagnosed with Patent Ductus Arteriosus (PDA), demonstrated that treatment significantly reduced the risk of death but increased the risk of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and death/BPD, especially among those requiring invasive ventilation. This suggests a complex relationship between PDA treatment and survival outcomes, advocating for individualized treatment plans. Concurrently, the Swissped RECOVERY trial compared the efficacy of methylprednisolone versus intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG) in treating Pediatric Inflammatory Multisystem Syndrome-Temporally Associated with SARS-CoV-2 (PIMS-TS), finding no significant difference in cardiac outcomes between the two treatments. This indicates that methylprednisolone could serve as an acceptable first-line treatment for PIMS-TS, although the study calls for further research due to its small sample size. Together, these studies highlight the critical need for personalized treatment strategies in pediatric care, particularly for conditions with complex pathophysiology and treatment outcomes.
