Recent advancements in medical imaging and machine learning have significantly improved the prognostic assessment and treatment planning for cancer patients, as evidenced by a series of pivotal studies. One such study introduces the Intelligent Prognosis Evaluation System (IPES) for stage I-III resected non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients, leveraging self-supervised pre-training and multi-task learning to analyze CT images from thousands of patients, offering a non-invasive method for detailed prognosis-related information. Similarly, research on non-functional pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (NF-PanNETs) has developed a predictive model for lymph node metastasis (LNM) using contrast-enhanced CT images and radiomics deep learning signatures, integrating these with clinicopathological factors into a nomogram with excellent predictive performance for LNM and disease-free survival. This model challenges the clinical guideline concerning the 2-cm threshold for tumor lymph node dissection, suggesting its utility across different tumor sizes. Additionally, a study focused on bladder cancer (BCa) patients has developed a deep learning model analyzing three-phase enhanced CT images, which, when combined with clinical features, offers superior predictive performance for recurrence-free and overall survival, introducing a novel approach for risk stratification in BCa management. Complementing these findings, a novel study developed and validated the DERBY and DERBY+ models, aimed at predicting the efficacy of bevacizumab treatment in patients with initially unresectable colorectal cancer liver metastases (CRLM). Utilizing data from a multicentre cohort study, including PET/CT images, clinical data, and colonoscopy biopsy specimens, the DERBY+ model, which integrates histopathological features, demonstrated promising accuracy in predicting bevacizumab sensitivity, marking significant improvements in progression-free and overall survival rates for responders. This approach underscores the potential of combining deep neural networks and random forest classifiers with multi-modal data towards personalized treatment strategies for CRLM patients. Together, these studies underscore the transformative potential of integrating advanced imaging analysis with machine learning in enhancing decision-making in the surgical and prognostic management of cancer, marking a significant step forward in the precision of cancer care.
