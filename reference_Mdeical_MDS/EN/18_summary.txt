This survey examines two distinct areas of healthcare research, focusing on the follow-up care for individuals after hospital-treated self-harm and the evaluation of anogenital injury (AGI) rates in the context of sexual assault versus consensual sexual intercourse. The first study, a comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis, analyzed data from 189 publications involving 243,953 individuals across 44 countries to assess psychiatric inpatient and outpatient treatment referrals post-self-harm. It found that a significant portion of these individuals did not receive the recommended psychiatric care, with only a quarter referred for inpatient care and just over a third for outpatient care, highlighting a gap in the provision of critical aftercare. The second study, by comparing AGI rates in 3165 women from 10 studies, revealed that AGI was more common in sexual assault cases than in consensual encounters, though the presence of AGI alone could not definitively prove or refute the occurrence of sexual assault. This underscores the complexity of using physical evidence in legal judgments of sexual violence and points to the need for a nuanced understanding of such injuries. Both studies illuminate the challenges in healthcare and legal systems in adequately addressing and supporting individuals following traumatic experiences, emphasizing the necessity for improved criteria and methods in both psychiatric aftercare decision-making and the forensic evaluation of sexual violence.
