In recent clinical trials, innovative approaches to enhance the treatment of hematologic malignancies have been explored, demonstrating the potential for improved patient outcomes through the modification of existing therapies and the introduction of novel combinations. A multicentre, phase 2 trial conducted in Austria and Switzerland evaluated the substitution of BCNU with bendamustine (BendaEAM) in the conditioning regimen before autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) for patients with relapsed lymphoma, finding no significant difference in lung toxicity, acute toxicities, overall survival rates, complete remission rates after 1 year, and quality of life when compared to the traditional BEAM regimen, suggesting BendaEAM as a viable alternative. Concurrently, the TOCILAM study, a phase 1 trial at Nantes University Hospital in France, assessed the safety and efficacy of combining tocilizumab, an anti-IL-6 receptor monoclonal antibody, with standard intensive induction chemotherapy in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients. This trial found the combination to be safe, without dose-limiting toxicities, and effective, with a high response rate among evaluable patients, recommending a dose of 8 mg/kg for future studies. Both studies underscore the importance of exploring innovative treatment modifications and combinations in the quest for optimal conditioning regimens and therapeutic strategies, offering new avenues for the treatment of lymphoma and AML patients.
