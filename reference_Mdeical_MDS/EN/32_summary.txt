Recent studies have shed light on the critical role of undiagnosed and modifiable risk factors in the development of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and their implications for public health strategies. A comprehensive analysis of 226,759 CVD-free participants aged 40 and above from the UK Biobank, spanning from 2006-2010 to September 2021, revealed age-specific impacts of 14 modifiable risk factors on CVD and mortality. This study highlighted that metabolic factors, particularly hypertension and abdominal obesity, exert the most significant influence across all age groups, while the importance of behavioral and socioeconomic factors varies with age. It suggests that targeted preventive measures focusing on the most impactful factors for each age group could significantly enhance CVD prevention and management strategies. In parallel, a study from England utilizing data from the Health Survey for England (2015-2019) found a significant portion of adults with undiagnosed hypertension, influenced by factors such as younger age, lower BMI, and self-perceived good health, alongside sociodemographic disparities. Meanwhile, research from Korea, through a nationwide health screening database, established a link between various subtypes of steatotic liver disease (SLD) and increased risks of developing CVD, emphasizing the additive effects of alcohol consumption on cardiometabolic risk factors. These findings collectively underscore the necessity for increased awareness and targeted screening strategies to identify and manage these largely preventable conditions. By addressing undiagnosed hypertension, distinguishing between SLD subtypes, and focusing on age-specific modifiable risk factors, public health efforts can be significantly optimized to improve long-term health outcomes and reduce the burden of CVD.
