Both studies shed light on the escalating burden of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and their risk factors in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), albeit focusing on different health issues. The first study conducts a comprehensive review and meta-analysis on the prevalence of NCDs among people living with HIV (PLHIV), revealing significant rates of hypertension, depression, diabetes, and other NCDs, alongside risk factors such as overweight/obesity and alcohol consumption. It emphasizes the need for health system strengthening and the integration of NCD and HIV services. The second study, utilizing data from the Global Burden of Disease Study, examines the burden and risk factors of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) from 1990 to 2019, highlighting a dramatic increase in COPD prevalence and its association with household air pollution from solid fuels. Both studies underscore the critical public health challenges posed by NCDs in SSA, pointing to the necessity for targeted health interventions, policy formulation, and further research to address the comprehensive health needs and risk factors associated with these diseases in the region.
