Recent clinical trials across Asia have showcased innovative approaches to treating challenging cancers, with a focus on combining targeted therapies with immunotherapy and chemotherapy to enhance treatment efficacy and safety. In China, a phase 2 trial (CTONG1702-Arm 8) evaluated AZD3759, a novel EGFR-TKI known for its significant CNS penetration, in untreated patients with EGFR-mutated non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and CNS metastases. The trial, which involved 30 patients across two dose cohorts (200 mg and 300 mg bid), achieved a primary endpoint with a confirmed objective response rate (ORR) of 70% and a median progression-free survival of 12.9 months, introducing AZD3759 as a promising first-line therapy for this patient population. Notably, the 200 mg bid cohort showed superior clinical outcomes and a lower incidence of severe treatment-related adverse events compared to the 300 mg cohort, suggesting a potential for better clinical outcomes and a manageable safety profile. Meanwhile, in Japan, a phase 2 study on NSCLC patients who progressed after first-line treatments explored the combination of docetaxel and ramucirumab, achieving an ORR of 34.4% with a manageable safety profile, suggesting a viable second-line therapy option. Additionally, a phase 1 trial for HER2-positive advanced gastric and gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma tested a novel regimen of pyrotinib, camrelizumab, and chemotherapy, identifying a maximum tolerated dose for pyrotinib and achieving a 77.8% ORR at the recommended phase 2 dose. These studies collectively underscore the potential of leveraging targeted therapies in combination with immunotherapy and chemotherapy, marking significant strides in the development of more effective treatment protocols for advanced cancers. The integration of AZD3759 into the treatment landscape for EGFR-mutated NSCLC with CNS metastases, alongside the exploration of new combination therapies in Japan, highlights a broader trend towards personalized and more effective cancer treatment strategies.
