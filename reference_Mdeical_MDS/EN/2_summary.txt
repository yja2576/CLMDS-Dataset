The recent studies on the global trends in Autoimmune Hepatitis (AIH) from 1970 to 2022, the burden of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) in Sub-Saharan Africa from 1990 to 2019, and the ethnic differences in the incidence of post-chemoradiotherapy pneumonitis among patients with locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer, collectively offer profound insights into the epidemiology of chronic diseases, underscoring the significant increases in prevalence and the influence of geographical, demographic, and ethnic factors. The AIH research highlights a global rise in cases, particularly in regions with high Human Development Index, North America, Oceania, and among females and adults in latitudes above 45Â°, suggesting environmental or genetic predispositions. Similarly, the COPD study points to a dramatic increase in cases in Sub-Saharan Africa, largely attributed to household air pollution from solid fuels, with severe impacts on disability and premature mortality, especially in Central SSA. Adding a new dimension to the understanding of chronic disease prevalence, the study on post-chemoradiotherapy pneumonitis reveals a significant ethnic disparity, with Asian patients experiencing higher rates of pneumonitis across all grades compared to non-Asian patients, indicating an ethnic sensitivity in lung tolerance to radiation. This finding, drawn from an analysis of 248 studies involving 28,267 patients, not only adds to the complexity of managing chronic diseases but also emphasizes the need for tailored treatment approaches that consider ethnic susceptibility. Together, these studies reflect the broader epidemiological trends of increasing chronic disease prevalence worldwide, influenced by a confluence of environmental, demographic, and now, ethnic factors, highlighting the urgent need for targeted interventions and further research in underrepresented regions to mitigate the growing public health challenges.
