Recent studies highlight the importance of specialized interventions in improving outcomes for patients with complex medical conditions. Research conducted across 11 German Centres for Rare Diseases (CRDs) demonstrated that incorporating mental health specialists into the diagnostic process significantly enhances diagnostic outcomes, patient satisfaction, and the efficiency of referrals to regular care for patients with undiagnosed, complex symptoms. This approach not only shortened the median time to diagnosis but also increased the proportion of established diagnoses within 12 months. Similarly, a study in a Norwegian primary care setting investigated the effectiveness of the Individual Challenge Inventory Tool (ICIT), a communication tool based on cognitive-behavioral therapy, for patients with Medically Unexplained Physical Symptoms (MUPS). The ICIT was found to significantly improve function, symptoms, quality of life, and work-related self-efficacy, while also reducing sick leave over an 11-week period, compared to usual care. Both studies underscore the potential benefits of integrating specialized tools and multidisciplinary expertise in medical care, particularly for patients presenting with complex and undiagnosed symptoms, suggesting that such approaches can lead to better health outcomes, enhanced patient satisfaction, and reduced healthcare burdens.
