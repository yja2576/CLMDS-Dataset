Recent advancements in machine learning and deep learning have shown promising applications in the medical field, particularly in optimizing patient care and treatment strategies. One study introduces the DemDx Ophthalmology Triage System (DOTS), a machine learning system designed to enhance triage efficiency in ophthalmic emergency departments. Developed and validated across different settings, including Moorfields Eye Hospital in London and the Federal University of Minas Gerais in Brazil, DOTS leverages demographic and clinical features to accurately triage patients, demonstrating high sensitivity and specificity. This system aims to reduce unnecessary emergency visits, showcasing its potential in improving emergency department operations and patient management in ophthalmology. Another study focuses on the development of DERBY and its enhanced version, DERBY+, multi-modal deep learning models that predict the efficacy of bevacizumab treatment in patients with initially unresectable colorectal cancer liver metastases (CRLM). By analyzing data from a multicentre cohort study, including PET/CT images, clinical data, and colonoscopy biopsy specimens, these models, especially DERBY+, which incorporates histopathological features, have shown significant accuracy in predicting treatment sensitivity. This approach suggests a pathway towards personalized treatment strategies for CRLM patients, underscoring the need for further research to validate and explore the clinical impact of these findings. Both studies exemplify the potential of integrating machine learning and deep learning in medical diagnostics and treatment planning, highlighting a shift towards more efficient and personalized patient care.
