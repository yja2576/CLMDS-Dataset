Recent studies in France and the Netherlands have shed light on the significant role that socio-environmental factors and gender norms play in influencing access to healthcare and the illness experience in individuals with serious health conditions, such as cancer and Parkinson's disease (PD). In France, a comprehensive analysis of over half a million cancer patients revealed that factors like economic deprivation, social isolation, and inaccessibility to public transport disproportionately hinder healthcare access, with a more pronounced negative impact on women. Meanwhile, in the Netherlands, research at the Radboud University Medical Centre involving men and women with PD highlighted how gender stereotypes and roles deeply affect the illness experience, influencing personal behaviors and societal attitudes. Both studies underscore the complex interplay between gender, socio-environmental factors, and health, emphasizing the need for targeted interventions and gender-sensitive care practices to ensure equitable healthcare access and improve the quality of care for individuals facing serious health conditions.
