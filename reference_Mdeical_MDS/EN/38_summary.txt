Recent studies utilizing data from the Health Survey for England (2015-2019) and the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) Aurum have shed light on significant health disparities in England. The first study reveals a notable prevalence of undiagnosed hypertension among adults, with younger individuals, those with lower BMI, and those reporting better health being more likely to have undiagnosed hypertension. Factors such as gender, geographic location, marital status, and educational level also influence the likelihood of undiagnosed hypertension, indicating that traditionally low-risk groups may not be receiving necessary screenings. The second study highlights ethnic inequities in routine childhood vaccination coverage from 2006 to 2021, showing that children from minority ethnic backgrounds, particularly Caribbean and other Black, African, and Caribbean backgrounds, have significantly lower vaccination rates compared to their White British counterparts. Despite some groups having similar rates to the White British population, disparities have widened over time, suggesting a growing need for targeted policy interventions. Both studies underscore the importance of addressing health disparities through increased awareness, expanded screening efforts, and policy actions tailored to address the specific needs of underrepresented and vulnerable populations in England.
