The recent studies offer a comprehensive overview of the challenges and considerations in post-pandemic healthcare, focusing on the long-term health effects of COVID-19, the nuances of antibiotic prescribing practices, and the implications of telemedicine. The COVIDENCE UK study underscores the persistent symptoms and reduced health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in individuals with past SARS-CoV-2 infections, highlighting unique long-term impacts such as problems with taste/smell and lightheadedness, and advocating for broader healthcare strategies to address these sequelae. Concurrently, an observational study delves into the association between consultation mode (remote versus face-to-face) and antibiotic prescribing for acute respiratory infections in primary care in England, revealing a 23% higher likelihood of antibiotic prescribing in remote consultations for adults, though no significant difference was observed for children. This study, employing advanced causal inference techniques, emphasizes the need for careful antibiotic stewardship in the era of telemedicine, particularly for adult patients. Another piece of research examines the quality and incorporation of antimicrobial stewardship principles within COVID-19 antibiotic prescribing guidelines, identifying a significant association between the presence of infectious disease expertise in guideline panels and the incorporation of stewardship principles. This points to the necessity for improved guideline development to combat both COVID-19 and antimicrobial resistance effectively. Together, these studies highlight the importance of a nuanced approach to healthcare in the aftermath of the pandemic, advocating for tailored interventions to manage long-term symptoms and the judicious use of antibiotics to prevent further health crises, while also considering the impact of telemedicine on prescribing practices.
