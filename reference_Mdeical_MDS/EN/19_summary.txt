Recent studies have highlighted the significant impact of lifestyle and modifiable risk factors on the incidence of chronic diseases, including cardiovascular disease (CVD), chronic kidney disease (CKD), and now, Parkinson's disease (PD). A pivotal investigation utilizing data from 226,759 CVD-free participants aged 40 and above from the UK Biobank, spanning from 2006-2010 to September 2021, underscored the age-specific impacts of 14 modifiable risk factors on CVD and mortality. This research revealed that metabolic factors, notably hypertension and abdominal obesity, consistently exert the most significant influence across all age groups on CVD risk, while the relevance of behavioral and socioeconomic factors varies with age. Complementing this, a study within the UK Biobank involving over 500,000 participants demonstrated that higher levels of physical activity (PA), including strenuous sports and walking, are associated with a reduced risk of CKD, highlighting the protective role of PA against CKD, irrespective of genetic predispositions. Furthermore, research on a Korean cohort of 351,068 individuals found that all subtypes of steatotic liver disease (SLD)—including metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), MASLD with increased alcohol intake (MetALD), and alcohol-related liver disease (ALD)—pose an elevated risk for CVD. Adding to this body of evidence, a prospective cohort study utilizing data from the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) waves 5-8 on 64,273 older adults, investigates the association between chronic diseases and multimorbidity patterns (somatic, neuropsychiatric, and cardiometabolic) and their impact on the risk of developing new-onset Parkinson's disease (PD) and related functional degeneration. The findings reveal that individuals with these multimorbidity patterns, especially those of recent onset, face a significantly higher risk (1.40-2.70 times) of PD, with the risk being more pronounced in lower-income participants, and recent-onset neuropsychiatric multimorbidity is associated with accelerated functional deterioration and cognitive decline. Collectively, these studies advocate for the integration of specific health measures and lifestyle modifications into clinical and public health strategies, aiming to mitigate the growing burden of chronic diseases globally. The convergence of findings across these studies highlights the critical role of modifiable lifestyle factors and the potential for age-specific interventions in the prevention and management of chronic diseases, underscoring a more nuanced approach to public health efforts and suggesting that early prevention of multimorbidity could potentially mitigate some subsequent cases of PD and related functional degeneration.
