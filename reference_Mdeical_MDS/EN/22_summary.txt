The recent collection of studies underscores the critical interplay between modifiable risk factors and the development of cardiovascular disease (CVD), presenting insights from diverse populations and conditions. A study from Korea meticulously explores the relationship between various subtypes of steatotic liver disease (SLD)—including metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), MASLD with increased alcohol intake (MetALD), and alcohol-related liver disease (ALD)—highlighting the heightened risks of CVD associated with each subtype, particularly when compounded by alcohol consumption. Concurrently, research utilizing data from the UK Biobank delves into the age-specific impacts of 14 modifiable risk factors on CVD and mortality, revealing significant age-related differences in the influence of these factors, with metabolic factors such as hypertension and abdominal obesity being consistently critical across all age groups. Adding a novel dimension to this discourse, a study within a Dutch cohort of 1910 children aged 10 investigates the prevalence, risk factors, and cardio-metabolic outcomes of Metabolic-Associated Fatty Liver Disease (MAFLD), employing MRI to measure liver fat fraction and assess metabolic health. This study finds that a significant portion of children met MAFLD criteria, with non-European descent being a notable risk factor, and those with MAFLD showing a higher risk of cardio-metabolic risk factor clustering, thereby emphasizing the importance of early identification and intervention. Together, these studies highlight the nuanced relationship between liver health, particularly MASLD and MAFLD, and CVD risk, suggesting that ethnicity and socio-economic factors may play a role in disease prevalence and outcomes. They collectively advocate for tailored public health strategies and clinical interventions that address modifiable risk factors, considering specific conditions like SLD subtypes or focusing on impactful risk factors across different age groups, to effectively reduce CVD risk.
