This survey examines two distinct approaches to COVID-19 treatment and prevention through clinical trials conducted across various countries. The first study focuses on the evaluation of a monovalent (D614) SARS-CoV-2 recombinant protein vaccine with AS03 adjuvant, assessing its efficacy, safety, and reactogenicity in a Phase 3 trial. It reveals a variable efficacy rate, with limited protection in SARS-CoV-2 naïve participants but higher efficacy in those previously exposed to the virus, suggesting its potential as a booster vaccine. The vaccine was found to be well-tolerated with an acceptable safety profile. The second study investigates the safety and efficacy of inhaled interferon-β1a (SNG001) for treating adults with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 in a Phase II trial. Although it showed no significant differences in most measured outcomes, there was a non-statistically significant trend towards reduced hospitalizations, indicating a potential therapeutic benefit that warrants further investigation. Both studies highlight the ongoing efforts to combat COVID-19, showcasing the exploration of vaccines and therapeutic treatments to mitigate the impact of the virus and its variants, despite facing challenges such as variant-induced efficacy reduction and the need for more conclusive therapeutic efficacy data.
