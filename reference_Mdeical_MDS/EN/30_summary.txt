Recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses have illuminated critical gaps in healthcare, revealing significant insights into the epidemiology of diseases and the effectiveness of healthcare systems worldwide. A comprehensive study on Autoimmune Hepatitis (AIH) utilizing data from 37 studies and over 239 million participants across 18 countries from 1970 to 2022 found that the global pooled incidence and prevalence of AIH were 1.28 and 15.65 cases per 100,000 inhabitants, respectively. This study highlighted significant geographical and demographic variations, with higher rates observed in countries with high Human Development Index, North America, Oceania, among females, adults, and regions above 45Â° latitude, and pointed towards an increasing trend in AIH incidence and prevalence globally. Similarly, a study focusing on the global seroprevalence of Hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibody in pregnant women, involving data from 192 studies and over 148 million pregnant women across 53 countries, revealed a global HCV seroprevalence of 1.80%, with significant regional variations and identified risk factors such as opioid use disorder and HIV infection. This underscores the urgent need for expanded HCV screening and research into safe treatments for pregnant women. In contrast, an analysis of data from 189 publications involving 243,953 individuals across 44 countries on the referral rates for psychiatric treatment following hospital-treated self-harm uncovered that only a fraction of those who self-harmed were referred to or received psychiatric treatment, with older adults being notably underserved. These findings indicate substantial deficiencies in post-hospitalization care and emphasize the necessity for enhanced aftercare strategies to prevent repeat self-harm and suicide. Together, these studies not only reveal the pressing need for improved healthcare interventions in managing infectious diseases among pregnant women and psychiatric care following self-harm but also highlight the importance of addressing geographical and demographic disparities in disease incidence and healthcare provision. They collectively point towards a broader imperative for healthcare systems worldwide to address these critical areas, aligning with global health goals such as the WHO's aim to eliminate HCV by 2030 and improving the overall quality of healthcare delivery.
