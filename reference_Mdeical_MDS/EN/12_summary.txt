Recent research within the COVIDENCE UK framework and a multicentre cohort study across nine UK hospitals has shed light on the long-term health impacts of SARS-CoV-2 and the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines among specific populations. The former study delved into the long-term symptom profiles and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in individuals post-SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to those with non-COVID-19 acute respiratory infections (ARIs) and uninfected controls, revealing a spectrum of persistent symptoms and reduced HRQoL, particularly noting significant associations with taste/smell issues and lightheadedness in post-SARS-CoV-2 cases. It emphasized the need for extended research and healthcare strategies to address the long-term effects of ARIs. The latter study focused on the neutralizing antibody responses against the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron BA.4/5 variant and wild-type virus in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) following vaccination, highlighting reduced responses in patients on specific treatments like anti-TNF and JAK-inhibitor therapy, and suggesting the potential benefit of bivalent vaccine boosters for these immunosuppressed individuals. Together, these studies underscore the complex and varied impacts of COVID-19 and its vaccines, advocating for tailored healthcare interventions to mitigate long-term effects and optimize vaccine efficacy in vulnerable groups.
