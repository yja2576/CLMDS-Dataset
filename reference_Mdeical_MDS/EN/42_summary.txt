Recent clinical trials have illuminated the potential of innovative combination therapies in the treatment of advanced cancers, showcasing a range of approaches and outcomes. A phase II trial demonstrated the efficacy and safety of sintilimab combined with albumin-bound paclitaxel in recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer, achieving an objective response rate of 44.4%, a disease control rate of 88.9%, and manageable toxicity, despite significant adverse events in nearly half of the participants. Similarly, the SCORPION trial in Japan evaluated the combination of docetaxel plus ramucirumab as a second-line therapy for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients, resulting in a 34.4% objective response rate with a manageable safety profile and no treatment-related deaths. Adding to this body of research, the study "Fecal microbiota transplantation plus tislelizumab and fruquintinib in refractory microsatellite stable metastatic colorectal cancer: an open-label, single-arm, phase II trial (RENMIN-215)" explored a novel regimen for refractory MSS metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC), known for its low response to PD-1 inhibitors. By integrating fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) with anti-PD-1 therapy tislelizumab and antiangiogenic therapy fruquintinib, the trial aimed to enhance treatment efficacy, reporting a median progression-free survival (PFS) of 9.6 months, overall survival (OS) of 13.7 months, and a manageable safety profile, with 95% of patients experiencing at least one treatment-related adverse event. This study also highlighted the importance of the gut microbiome in immunotherapy efficacy, suggesting potential biomarkers for treatment response through exploratory biomarker analysis of microbiome compositions and T-cell receptor (TCR) characteristics in responders. Collectively, these studies underscore the potential of combining targeted therapies and chemotherapy, or innovative approaches like FMT with immunotherapy, in improving outcomes for patients with advanced cancers. They highlight the need for further research through larger randomized controlled trials to validate these promising results and explore the underlying mechanisms of action and potential biomarkers for treatment response.
