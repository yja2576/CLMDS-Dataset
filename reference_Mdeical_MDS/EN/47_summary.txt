Recent advancements in the application of advanced imaging techniques and machine learning are revolutionizing the precision of prognostic and predictive models in cancer care, as evidenced by three groundbreaking studies. The first study introduces an Intelligent Prognosis Evaluation System (IPES) that leverages pre-therapy CT images to predict overall survival risk in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. By employing self-supervised pre-training and multi-task learning, it refines the precision of the traditional TNM staging system, enabling the stratification of patients into distinct risk groups for more tailored treatment approaches. Similarly, the second study develops a predictive model for lymph node metastasis (LNM) in non-functional pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (NF-PanNETs) using contrast-enhanced CT images and radiomics deep learning signatures, combined with clinicopathological factors into a nomogram. This model, validated across two institutions, not only shows high predictive accuracy for LNM and disease-free survival but also challenges the existing 2-cm threshold guideline for tumor lymph node dissection, advocating for a more nuanced approach to surgical decision-making. Building on these advancements, the third study focuses on bladder cancer (BCa) patients, aiming to enhance postoperative recurrence risk prediction. By developing and validating a deep learning (DL) model that analyzes three-phase enhanced CT images of 874 BCa patients from four centers, this research achieves superior predictive performance over existing models. The DL signature, integrating DL scores with clinical features, demonstrates a concordance index of 0.869 and an area under curve of 0.889 in the validation set, offering a novel approach for stratifying patients into high and low-risk groups for recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS). Together, these studies underscore the potential of combining advanced imaging and machine learning to not only enhance the precision of cancer prognosis and treatment but also highlight a shift towards more personalized and accurate diagnostic and therapeutic strategies in oncology, reflecting a broader trend of innovation across different cancer types and outcomes.
